        <p>Hello my love,

It’s safe to say that these past 9 months have gone by incredibly fast. At the same time it feels like forever because when i look at where we were at the beginning and where we are now it feels like I’ve known you for a lifetime. From the moment I saw you it was love at first sight. I knew there was something about you. Everytime I looked at you there was this hunger inside me, this feeling that told me you have to have her. Finding out that you liked me was crazy and really hard to believe. But im so glad we were able to get together because what came from it is truly something special yomn. What we have is something so rare, that I have never seen it anywhere else. Can you think of two people more perfectly made to suit each other? Its almost like every quality we have is made to compliment or help the other person. I for one am the happiest guy alive because I have truly chosen the perfect person to spend my eternity with. Some people aren’t that lucky and im grateful for god, because he sent me a true angel. He sent me my wife.

Yomn every time I look at you I still get those butterflies I used to get. I still trip up on my words because when you stare at me intently the way that you do, it makes me feel like I have forgotten everything, because suddenly everything stops mattering, everything except the beautiful girl in front of me. Your eyes still encapsulate me from the moment I look into them, it feels like I can see my entire future when I look into those gorgeous eyes of yours. Your hair is the softest and most perfect combination of colours that I’ve ever seen. I love smelling it and running my hand through it. It makes me feel so calm and makes me feel so happy. I’m mesmerised when I look at you. Your features, every single one of them, your eyes, your lips, your nose, your ears, your face, your body, your pimples, the slight cracks in your skin, all the other imperfections, tell your story. They tell the story of a resilient, hardworking, loving, caring, determined, and full of life individual. The kind of person who has fought hard to be in the position they’re in, the kind of person who deserves every good thing the world has to offer, the best kind of person. I love all your imperfections, along with every other part of you. You are the most beautiful girl to ever exist and who will ever exist allah gandhi hua, and you are perfect from your head to your toes, inside and out allah gandhi hua. You exude beauty with every step you take and what your body does to me every single time needs to be studied. I go insane for every detail and I crave the moment when I get to touch, kiss and love every single inch of you.

From the very beginning, I knew you were different. You’ve shown me loyalty, trust, and dedication in ways I’ve never known. Even with the challenges of long distance, you’ve been my constant, my safe space, the one person I can always count on. Every time I think about how loyal you are to me, how you’d never look at anyone else the way you look at me, it gives me this deep sense of security. I’ve always been afraid of whoever i ended up with cheating on me or leaving me for someone else, but with you that fear is not there. I know I can trust you from a million miles away and I know that you share the same belief as me that we are perfect for each other and no one else in the world matters, just us baby. It’s a feeling I never thought I would experience, but you’ve made it real for me. You’ve taught me how to trust, how to let my guard down, and how to love fully without fear.

i love you baby, happy 9 months.

Love, Alvaan
